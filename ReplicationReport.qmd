## Introduction

Polite speech poses a challenge for assumptions about accurate and efficient information transfer in communication in both classical Gricean pragmatics and more recent probabilistic pragmatics frameworks. For the sake of being polite, speakers opt for utterances that are indirect, underinformative, and sometimes even irrelevant or untruthful. To account for how polite speech arises, Yoon et al. (2020) propose a probabilistic cognitive model which is based on the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework and incorporates three different informational and social utilities into its machinery. They hypothesize that underlying a speaker’s polite language use is a competition between three goals: to be informative, to be kind (to save the listener’s face), and to present oneself in a good light – quantitatively formalized as three separate weighted utilities (informational, prosocial, and self-presentational) contributing to the total utterance utility. Crucially, the model predictions and results of the authors' production experiment converge on the following polite speech pattern: when describing a bad state, a speaker whose goal is to be both informative and kind would produce more indirect, negated utterances - saying, for example, that something is "not bad" or "not terrible" even though they actually feel much more negatively about it. This replication project aims to reproduce this key finding in Yoon et al.'s (2020) production experiment.


## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

The experiment has a 4x3 factorial design: true state (0, 1, 2, 3 hearts) x speaker’s goals (informative, kind, both).

### Procedure	

First, participants read a scenario where person A doesn’t know how good their creative work is and ask for person B’s opinion on it. Then, they are given 2 pieces of information: (i) how B truly feels about A’s creative work shown in the form of red hearts, and (ii) what B’s goals in communicating an answer to A are.
Finally, they are asked to indicate what the speaker B would most likely say given those two pieces of information. Formula for indicating speaker B’s most likely production: It + was/wasn’t (chosen from dropdown menu) + terrible/bad/good/amazing (chosen from dropdown menu) 


### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
